# :speak_no_evil: secrets-js

Simple CLI tool to handle encrypted secrets, heavily inspired in [Symfony Secrets](https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration/secrets.html).

With `secrets` you can set and store your credentials encrypted, and dump it in plain whenever you want.

## init
Execute `secrets init` to create a default config file template and the folder to store the keys.

## generate-keypair
With `secrets generate-keypair` you will generate your keypair. It will be used to encrypt all your data.

**:warning: CAUTION:** Never commit your private key files to a version control system.
